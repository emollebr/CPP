- initializing fx ContactArray in PhoneBook??? without dynamuc alloc
- when should a string be const, what is the difference from a std::string
- how to use string functions, how to compare values like !=, ==, ! etc.
- from std::cin to const char* ??
- get return (num of char printed) from std::cout?

char const vs const char?

hoe to have array of a class but uninitialized as member of another class?

namespace:

initializations list:
	constructor taking attributes
	ex. contact class constructor taking attributes first name, last name etc
	called by the phonebook::add whoch asks info from user via std::cin
syntax:
	contact::contact(char *fn, char *ln ...) : _firstname(fn), _lastname(ln), ...
	
const:
	- initialize constant class members through the constructor
	- const keyword after closing bracket at function declaration means the function will not alter 			
	current instance of class

compilation
- remember include guards but all dependencies in each header
- no function implementation in  aheader file
